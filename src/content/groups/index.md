If you'd like to start a meetup in Syracuse, please reach out to the organizers
at Syracuse.io. We're happy to connect you with community members who might be
interested in attending.

You're also welcome to invite your members to join [Syracuse.io slack](/community/),
and coordinate events through this site.
