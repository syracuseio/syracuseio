We are a group dedicated to discussing and working with the JavaScript programming language.

Currently we meet the third Tuesday of each month, and each event has both a learning and
interactive portion. Whether you’re an experienced JavaScript programmer or just getting started,
we welcome and encourage all proficiency levels.

Come join us if you’d like to learn, teach, or participate in our fun code challenges!
